## Purpose
The purpose of this RecipeApp project is to learn how to code with react for fun and use my knowledge gained from programming with C# and JavaScript. 

## What does the project looks to achieve
This project looks to achieve the following goals:
1. Create an App where a user can go browse different recipes by searching
2. See what term they used to search displayed
3. Be able to filter the results of the search
4. These recipes are to be pulled from an external API
5. Two main pages are to be implemented: a start page (where users can search for different recipes) and a single recipe page (where users can get more details regarding a specific recipe).
6. Use color palette related to the area (food)
